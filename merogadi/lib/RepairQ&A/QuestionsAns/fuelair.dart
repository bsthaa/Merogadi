Also remove the throttle, choke linkages, and other items connected to the carburetor. Make sure to leave a guide mark on the removed items for ease in reinstallation. Donâ€™t forget to remove the fuel line from the carburetor and if there is fuel spill wipe it.\n\nOnce all the linkages have been disconnected, also remove the bolts or nuts which secure the carburetor using a socket or combination wrench. Remove the carburetor from the engine carefully and at a level because it contains fuel. Drain the fuel into a safe can and detach the old gasket from the intake manifold.\n\nRub the old gasket with a hand cloth. Proceed to install the new carburetor and gasket on the carburetor box. Secure its place with the bolts or nuts and reinstall the linkages you have removed earlier. Reconnect the vacuum line, the choke and throttle, and lastly the fuel line. Also replace the filters for fuel and air and reconnect the negative battery cable. Here you are simply replacing the items you removed so it should be easy to do.',
